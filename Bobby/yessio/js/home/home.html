<p>No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. Well, obviously, I'm not a big guy. I'm not a Carl Weathers, par example. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat. I just bought you a f**king pizza. Chaw-chee, chaw-chee chaw-chee! Coo coo ca cha! Ah coodle doodle do Caw ca caw, caw ca caw. So Ann, the question is, do you want a man or a boy? I know how I would answer.</p>

<p>Boy, I sure feel like a Mary without a Peter and a Paul. No. I was ashamed to be _seen_ with you. I like being with you.</p>

<p>We'll have to find something to do so that people can look at you without wanting to kill themselves. Don't ask "Can I"â€¦ ask "I Can!"</p>

<p>If I wanted something your thumb touched, I'd eat the inside of your ear. I'm foolish and I'm funny and I'm needy. Am I needy? Are you sure I'm not needy? 'Cause I feel needy sometimes. Yo quiero leche. Yo quiero leche de madre. Also, your knee is on my heart. Buster, what are you doing with mother's rape-horn? Well, yeah you've gotta lock that down.</p>

<p>Excuse me, do these effectively hide my thunder?</p>

<p>It's as Ann as the nose on plain's face. I've made a huge tiny mistake.</p>
